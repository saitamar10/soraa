    "faqs": {
      "1": {
        "question": "What is Sora2 and how does it differ from other AI video generators?",
        "answer": "Sora2 is OpenAI's breakthrough AI video generation model that creates cinema-quality videos with unprecedented realism. Unlike other generators, Sora2 understands physics, maintains character consistency, and generates complex scenes with multiple subjects, realistic lighting, and natural motion up to 10 seconds long in 1080p quality."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "What video formats and resolutions does Sora2 support?",
        "answer": "Sora2 generates professional 1080p videos in multiple aspect ratios: 16:9 (perfect for YouTube and traditional platforms), 9:16 (ideal for TikTok, Instagram Stories, and mobile content), and 1:1 (optimized for social media feeds). Videos can be up to 10 seconds long with consistent quality throughout."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "How realistic are Sora2's physics simulations?",
        "answer": "Sora2 features revolutionary physics understanding that accurately simulates real-world phenomena including gravity, fluid dynamics, object interactions, realistic lighting changes, and natural material properties. This results in videos that look incredibly lifelike, with objects moving and behaving exactly as they would in reality."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "Can Sora2 maintain character consistency across the entire video?",
        "answer": "Yes! One of Sora2's most impressive features is perfect character consistency. Whether generating from text or images, the same person, object, or character maintains identical appearance, clothing, and features throughout the entire 10-second video, solving a major challenge that other AI video generators struggle with."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "What types of content can I create with Sora2?",

It handles both text-to-video (describe your vision) and image-to-video (animate your photos) creation methods."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "How do I get the best results from Sora2?",
        "answer": "For optimal results: write detailed, specific prompts describing subjects, actions, lighting, and camera movements; use high-quality, well-lit source images; be clear about the style you want (cinematic, artistic, realistic); specify important details like clothing, environment, and mood; experiment with different prompt variations to find what works best for your vision."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "Is my content secure and private with Sora2?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. All your prompts, uploaded images, and generated videos are encrypted and completely private. We never share your content with third parties or use it for training purposes without explicit permission."
      },
